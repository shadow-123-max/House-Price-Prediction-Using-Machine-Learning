## Features

- Predict housing prices in Bangalore based on various features.
- User-friendly web interface to input data and receive predictions.
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
- Backend implemented using Flask web framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for model development and backend.
- **Flask**: Web framework for developing the backend of the application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model development.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predicting-housing-prices.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd predicting-housing-prices
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - For macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the web application.
